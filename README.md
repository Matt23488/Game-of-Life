# Game-of-Life
I had just learned SDL and made a simple app in C++ for Conway's Game of Life.

I then learned that someone had created a .NET Managed Code wrapper for SDL2.0.
I created what lies before you. I had high ambitions for this project. At the time
I was at two years graduated from college with no software engineering job.
Finally I got a job, and while I waited for my start date I had a "sudden"
interest in programming. (Imagine that.) I then became too busy at my job to
carry out this project. All's well, because I already had every intention to
rewrite it from scratch, as my design is poor and not suited for expanding functionality.
I have also learned quite a bit about good design patterns at my profession, so
whenever I feel up to the task, I'm going to branch this off as history, and do what
I had already intended to do, and rewrite the project on the master branch.

Hopefully I will have time, as I really want to. But it could be awhile, as I'm an
expecting father and my son Nathan is almost here! So in the meantime, feel free
to make fun of how crappy the first attempt was, and if you don't think it's crappy, you
can use my code for any reason as long as you credit me. (For more information, see
