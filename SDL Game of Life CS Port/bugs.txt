Bugs:

CellSize number box triggers an event when first loaded, looks buggy
Same with delay number box, but there is no visible indication
clear doesn't always clear the grid visually, after manipulating a structure

TODO:

Add an eraser tool that can erase a portion the user wants (like in mspaint or something). Can use existing code for adding structures, with bool[,] consisting of only false, although we'll need to bypass some stuff because the user doesn't need to confirm
Add an undo/redo system

Add more complicated variations such as variations with more than 2 states per cell

***Rewrite the SDL part to better incorporate future modifications
